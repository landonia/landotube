  		<h1>About Me</h1>
	  	<div id="post">
			<p>I write software for a living (if you couldn't guess that already).
				I have been a code monkey practically forever, gaining more
			experience everyday. I have had my ups (creating things is awesome) and my downs
			(but it can make you want to throw your computer out of the window at times).
			I still have so much to learn it's crazy, but I think that's a good thing.</p>
			<p>I have my own consulting company, Landonia, from which I pimp myself out on various contract gigs. Althouh tbh,
			 I'm far to busy in the day job these days. I will help with projects that do not distract from
		 	my main work, are not in conflict and of which I have an interest.</p>

			<p>So far I have worked for an <a href="http://www.jagex.com">online games company</a> in Cambridge,
			a <a href="http://www.intergral.com">server monitoring tools company</a> in Germany, a
			<a href="http://www.fizzback.com">customer feedback company</a> in London and at the largest online gambling site. I have also completed quite a few tours of duty
			consulting with Landonia Ltd. My latest position involves creating a top notch advanced industrial IOT application.
			The company itself is in the <a href="http://www.4energy.co.uk">energy industry</a></p>

			<p>Personally, I think about stuff way too much, even the smallest things. I see something, hear something,
			discuss something and I let them go on in my mind over and over. It drives me crazy, but over time I think it has allowed me
			to think about things logically and get ideas for things I think should be created.
			I now want to start putting these things into practice and it starts with this blog.
			It will be a challenge, I am a tinkerer at heart and my mind moves quickly to new things.
			I joke that my harddrive is the vault of broken dreams.</p>

			<p>The application was built using <a href="https://github.com/landonia/simplegoblog">simplegoblog</a> and written using <a href="http://golang.org/">Golang</a>.</p>
